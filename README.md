### 2. Spotify API Setup

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new application
3. Note your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
4. Add `http://localhost:8080/callback` to your redirect URIs

### 3. Plex Setup

1. **Get your Plex Token**:
   - Go to [Plex Web](https://app.plex.tv/web/app)
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Look for requests to `plex.tv` and find the `X-Plex-Token` header
   - Or use the [Plex Token Finder](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/general/plex-token/)
   - Or follow the instructions in [PLEX_AUTHENTICATION.md](PLEX_AUTHENTICATION.md)

2. **Find your Music Library Section ID**:
   - Go to your Plex server web interface
   - Navigate to your music library
   - The section ID is in the URL: `http://your-server:32400/web/index.html#!/media/plex/:/server/{server-id}/section/{section-id}/all`
   - Or check the Plex logs for section information

3. **Server ID (Optional - Auto-discovered)**:
   - The server ID can be automatically discovered from your Plex server
   - If auto-discovery fails, you can find it in the Plex Web UI URL or set it manually
   - Leave `PLEX_SERVER_ID` empty in your `.env` file to enable auto-discovery

### 4. Configuration

Copy the template environment file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp env.template .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

```env
# Spotify Configuration
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/callback

# Plex Configuration
PLEX_URL=http://your_plex_server:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=your_plex_token_here
PLEX_LIBRARY_SECTION_ID=your_music_library_section_id

# Playlist Configuration (Optional)
# Option 1: Set SPOTIFY_USERNAME to fetch all public playlists for a user
SPOTIFY_USERNAME=your_spotify_username_here

# Option 2: Comma-separated list of specific Spotify playlist IDs
SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=playlist_id_1,playlist_id_2,playlist_id_3


### 6. Configure Playlists (Optional)

You have two options for specifying which playlists to sync:

#### Option 1: Use Spotify Username (Recommended)
Set `SPOTIFY_USERNAME` in your `.env` file to fetch all public playlists for that user:
```env
SPOTIFY_USERNAME=your_spotify_username_here
```

#### Option 2: Use Specific Playlist IDs
1. Open Spotify and navigate to your playlist
2. Right-click and select "Share" ‚Üí "Copy link to playlist"
3. The playlist ID is the string after the last `/` in the URL
   - Example: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M`
   - Playlist ID: `37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M`

### 6. Configure Multiple Playlists (Optional)

You can sync multiple Spotify playlists at once by providing a comma-separated list:

```env
# Single playlist
SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M

# Multiple playlists
SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M,37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5N,37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5O
```

Each Spotify playlist will be synced to a new Plex playlist with the exact same name as the original Spotify playlist.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Build and run with playlist ID(s) from .env
make run

# Or run directly
go run main.go

# Or run the built binary
./bin/plexify
```

MISSING TRACKS SUMMARY

Tracks not found in Plex library (5 total):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Diplo - Get It Right
     Track ID: 4Qv9uaS4tPFlmG7Iac9uQJ
     ISRC: (not available)

  2. Some Artist - Some Song
     Track ID: 7x8dJ7q9K2L3M4N5O6P7Q8
     ISRC: USRC12345678
     MusicBrainz ID: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 (https://musicbrainz.org/recording/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012)

  3. Another Artist - Another Song
     Track ID: 1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J1K2L
     ISRC: (not available)
     MusicBrainz ID: (not found)

**Note:** The Missing Tracks Summary shows tracks that couldn't be found in your Plex library, including their Spotify Track ID, ISRC (International Standard Recording Code), and MusicBrainz ID when available. MusicBrainz IDs include direct links to the MusicBrainz website for easy access to additional track information. This information can be helpful for manually adding these tracks to your Plex library or for troubleshooting matching issues. MusicBrainz IDs are automatically looked up using the ISRC when available, or by searching for the artist and title combination.

## MusicBrainz Integration

Plexify includes integration with the MusicBrainz database to provide additional track identification information. When tracks are not found in your Plex library, Plexify will automatically:

1. **Search by ISRC** (if available): Uses the International Standard Recording Code to find the exact track in MusicBrainz
2. **Search by Artist/Title** (fallback): If ISRC is not available or not found, searches by artist and title combination

The MusicBrainz ID can be used to:
- Look up detailed track information on the MusicBrainz website
- Find alternative versions or releases of the same track
- Get additional metadata like recording dates, genres, and more
- Use with other music services that support MusicBrainz IDs

**API Rate Limiting:** MusicBrainz has rate limiting in place. Plexify respects these limits and will make requests at a reasonable pace to avoid being blocked.

## Configuration

Plexify supports multiple ways to configure settings, with the following hierarchy (highest priority first):

1. **CLI Flags** - Override everything else
2. **Environment Variables** - Loaded from `.env` file or system environment
3. **System Environment Variables** - Fallback if `.env` file doesn't exist

### CLI Flags

All environment variables can be set via CLI flags using the same names:

```bash
# Spotify configuration
./plexify -SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id -SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
./plexify -SPOTIFY_USERNAME=your_username
./plexify -SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M,37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5N

# Plex configuration
./plexify -PLEX_URL=http://your-server:32400 -PLEX_TOKEN=your_token
./plexify -PLEX_LIBRARY_SECTION_ID=6
./plexify -PLEX_SERVER_ID=your_server_id

# Legacy flags (still supported)
./plexify -username your_username -playlists playlist_id1,playlist_id2
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the same directory as the binary:

```env
# Spotify API credentials
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/callback
SPOTIFY_USERNAME=your_spotify_username
SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M,37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5N

# Plex Configuration
PLEX_URL=http://your_plex_server:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=your_plex_token_here
PLEX_LIBRARY_SECTION_ID=your_music_library_section_id
PLEX_SERVER_ID=your_server_id
```

### Configuration Priority Example

If you have:
- `SPOTIFY_USERNAME=user1` in your `.env` file
- `SPOTIFY_USERNAME=user2` as a system environment variable
- `./plexify -SPOTIFY_USERNAME=user3`

The final value will be `user3` (CLI flag takes precedence).

## Matching Functions

Plexify uses a sophisticated multi-step matching system to find songs from Spotify in your Plex library. The matching happens in a specific order, with each step trying different strategies to find the best match.

### Matching Order and Rules

#### 1. **Exact Title/Artist Match** (First Priority)
**When it applies:** All songs (highest priority for reliability)
**What it does:** Searches using the exact title and artist from Spotify without any modifications
**Rules:**
- Tries combined search: `"Song Title Artist Name"`
- Falls back to title-only search: `"Song Title"`
- Falls back to artist-only search: `"Artist Name"`
- Returns immediately if exact match is found (most reliable)

#### 2. **Single Quote Handling** (Second Priority)
**When it applies:** Songs with apostrophes or single quotes in the title or artist name
**What it does:** Tries different variations of the quote characters to handle encoding differences
**Rules:**
- Original title with quotes: `"Don't Stop Believin'"`
- Remove all quotes: `"Dont Stop Believin"`
- Replace with backtick: `"Don`t Stop Believin``"`
- Replace with prime symbol: `"Don‚Ä≤t Stop Believin‚Ä≤"`
- Replace with different quote: `"Don't Stop Believin'"`
- Expand contractions: `"Do not Stop Believin"`, `"Do not Stop Believin is"`

#### 3. **Bracket Removal** (Third Priority)
**When it applies:** Songs with text in parentheses, square brackets, or curly brackets
**What it does:** Removes bracketed content and searches again
**Rules:**
- `"Song Title (feat. Artist)"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
- `"Song Title [Remix]"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
- `"Song Title {Live}"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
- Cleans up extra spaces after removal

#### 4. **Featuring Removal** (Fourth Priority)
**When it applies:** Songs with featuring/feat/ft text in the title
**What it does:** Removes featuring information and searches again
**Rules:**
- `"Song Title featuring Artist"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
- `"Song Title feat. Artist"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
- `"Song Title ft. Artist"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
