# Plexify

A tool to sync Spotify playlists to playlists on your Plex server.

Can be run manually as a CLI, or scheduled as a cron task.

## Features

- üîç Fetch songs from Spotify playlists
- üìã Can take either a [list of Spotify playlists, or find all public playlists by username](#5-finding-playlists)
- üéµ Extract track metadata (title, artist, album, duration, ISRC)
- üéØ Match Spotify songs to Plex library using title/artist [using pre-defined rules](#matching-rules)
- üìù Create Plex playlists dynamically with matched songs, or update existing playlists
- üß† [Retrieve the MusicBrainz id](#musicbrainz-integration) for missing songs to make it easier to find them

## Prerequisites

- Spotify API credentials (**not** your username and password)
- Plex Media Server with music library, and the `X-Plex-Token` token

## Quick Start

### 1. Download Pre-built Binary

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/grrywlsn/plexify/releases):

**Linux (amd64):**

```bash
wget https://github.com/grrywlsn/plexify/releases/latest/download/plexify-linux-amd64 -O plexify && chmod +x plexify
```

**macOS (Intel):**

```bash
wget https://github.com/grrywlsn/plexify/releases/latest/download/plexify-darwin-amd64 -O plexify && chmod +x plexify
```

**macOS (Apple Silicon):**

```bash
wget https://github.com/grrywlsn/plexify/releases/latest/download/plexify-darwin-arm64 -O plexify && chmod +x plexify
```

**Windows:**
Download `plexify-windows-amd64.exe` from the [releases page](https://github.com/grrywlsn/plexify/releases) and rename to `plexify.exe`

### 2. Spotify API Setup

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new application
3. Note your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
4. Add `http://localhost:8080/callback` to your redirect URIs

### 3. Plex Setup

1. **Get your Plex Token**:

   - Go to [Plex Web](https://app.plex.tv/web/app)
   - Open Developer Tools
   - Go to Network tab
   - Look for requests to `plex.tv` and find the `X-Plex-Token` header
   - Or use the [Plex Token Finder](https://www.plexopedia.com/plex-media-server/general/plex-token/)
2. **Find your Music Library Section ID**:

   - Go to your Plex server web interface
   - Navigate to your music library
   - The section ID is in the URL as the `source`: `https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/media/abcdefg12345678/com.plexapp.plugins.library?source=6`
   - Or check the Plex logs for section information
3. **Server ID (Optional - Auto-discovered)**:

   - The server ID can be automatically discovered from your Plex server
   - If `PLEX_SERVER_ID` is unset, it will attempt auto-discovery
   - If auto-discovery fails, you can find it in the Plex Web UI URL and set it manually

### 4. Configuration

The variables for configuration are:

```env
# Spotify Configuration
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here

# Plex Configuration
PLEX_URL=http://your_plex_server:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=your_plex_token_here
PLEX_LIBRARY_SECTION_ID=your_music_library_section_id

# Playlist Configuration
# Option 1: Set SPOTIFY_USERNAME to fetch all public playlists for a user
SPOTIFY_USERNAME=your_spotify_username_here

# Option 2: Comma-separated list of specific Spotify playlist IDs
SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=playlist_id_1,playlist_id_2,playlist_id_3
```

These can be set either as environment variables, loaded from a `.env` file, or passed in as flags, like so:

```env
./plexify \
  -SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here \
  -SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here \
  -SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=5a1G7EQcb8D5Tw5lzMQEmr \
  -PLEX_URL=http://your_plex_server:32400 \
  -PLEX_TOKEN=your_plex_token_here \
  -PLEX_LIBRARY_SECTION_ID=6
```

### 5. Finding playlists

You can sync multiple Spotify playlists at once by providing a comma-separated list:

```env
# Single playlist
SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M

# Multiple playlists
SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M,37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5N,37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5O
```

* Open Spotify and navigate to your playlist
* Right-click and select "Share" ‚Üí "Copy link to playlist"
* The playlist ID is the string after the last `/` in the URL
  - Example: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M`
  - Playlist ID: `37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M`

Or you can provide a Spotify username and all public playlists will be found and synced:

```env
SPOTIFY_USERNAME=your_spotify_username_here
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each Spotify playlist will be synced to a new Plex playlist with the exact same name as the original. If a playlist of the same name exists in Plex, it will update it to match the matched Spotify tracks - this **will remove other songs if they exist**.

```

**Note:** The Missing Tracks Summary shows tracks that couldn't be found in your Plex library, including their Spotify Track ID, ISRC (International Standard Recording Code), and MusicBrainz ID when available.

## MusicBrainz Integration

Plexify includes integration with the MusicBrainz database to provide additional track identification information. When tracks are not found in your Plex library, plexify will automatically:

1. **Search by ISRC** (if available): Uses the International Standard Recording Code to find the exact track in MusicBrainz
2. **Search by Artist/Title** (fallback): If ISRC is not available or not found, searches by artist and title combination

The MusicBrainz ID can be used to:

- Look up detailed track information on the MusicBrainz website
- Find alternative versions or releases of the same track
- Get additional metadata like recording dates, genres, and more
- Use with other music services that support MusicBrainz IDs
- Add to Lidarr to search for an exact match or fix the metadata assigned to your files

**API Rate Limiting:** MusicBrainz has rate limiting in place. Plexify respects these limits and will make requests at a reasonable pace to avoid being blocked.

### Matching Order and Rules

#### 1. **Exact Title/Artist Match** (First Priority)

**When it applies:** All songs (highest priority for reliability)
**What it does:** Searches using the exact title and artist from Spotify without any modifications
**Rules:**

- Tries combined search: `"Song Title Artist Name"`
- Falls back to title-only search: `"Song Title"`
- Falls back to artist-only search: `"Artist Name"`
- Returns immediately if exact match is found (most reliable)

#### 2. **Single Quote Handling** (Second Priority)

**When it applies:** Songs with apostrophes or single quotes in the title or artist name
**What it does:** Tries different variations of the quote characters to handle encoding differences
**Rules:**

- Original title with quotes: `"Don't Stop Believin'"`
- Remove all quotes: `"Dont Stop Believin"`
- Replace with backtick: `"Don`t Stop Believin``"`
- Replace with prime symbol: `"Don‚Ä≤t Stop Believin‚Ä≤"`
- Replace with different quote: `"Don't Stop Believin'"`
- Expand contractions: `"Do not Stop Believin"`, `"Do not Stop Believin is"`

#### 3. **Bracket Removal** (Third Priority)

**When it applies:** Songs with text in parentheses, square brackets, or curly brackets
**What it does:** Removes bracketed content and searches again
**Rules:**

- `"Song Title (feat. Artist)"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`

- `"Song Title {Live}"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
- Cleans up extra spaces after removal

#### 4. **Featuring Removal** (Fourth Priority)

**When it applies:** Songs with featuring/feat/ft text in the title
**What it does:** Removes featuring information and searches again
**Rules:**

- `"Song Title featuring Artist"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
- `"Song Title feat. Artist"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
- `"Song Title ft. Artist"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`

#### 5. **Title Normalization** (Fifth Priority)

**When it applies:** Songs with dashes in the title that might be formatted differently in Plex
**What it does:** Converts dash-separated titles to parentheses format for better matching
**Rules:**

- `"Mood Ring - Pride Remix"` ‚Üí `"Mood Ring (Pride Remix)"`
- `"Song Title - Extended - Live"` ‚Üí `"Song Title (Extended) (Live)"`
- Handles multiple dashes by converting each to separate parentheses

#### 6. **"With" Removal** (Sixth Priority)

**When it applies:** Songs with "with" in the title that might be formatted differently
**What it does:** Removes "with" and any text after it from the title
**Rules:**

- `"Song Title with Artist"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
- `"With Artist - Song Title"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
- Cleans up trailing dashes and spaces after removal

#### 7. **Common Suffixes Removal** (Seventh Priority)

**When it applies:** Songs with common suffixes that might not be present in Plex
**What it does:** Removes common track suffixes and variations
**Rules:**

- `"Song Title - Bonus Track"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
- `"Song Title - Remix"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
- `"Song Title - Extended"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`
- `"Song Title - Radio Edit"` ‚Üí `"Song Title"`

- And many more variations (clean, explicit, demo, instrumental, etc.)

#### 8. **Full Library Search** (Eighth Priority - Fallback)

**When it applies:** When all other matching strategies fail
**What it does:** Searches through the entire music library to find potential matches
**Rules:**

- Uses the most comprehensive search method
- Applies similarity scoring to find the best match
- Used as a last resort when other methods don't find matches

## Matching issues

If you run into issues where plexify will not match a song that you know is in your Plex library, [please raise an issue in this repo](https://github.com/grrywlsn/plexify/issues), and include:

- the artist name and track name from Spotify
- the artist name and track name from your Plex

Please copy/paste them **exactly** as they appear in each source, so that the matching can be tested.

### Debug mode

You can enable debug logs (`DEBUG=true`) to see the rules being evaluated and how they are scored.

It should help make it clear why one song wins over another, and can be included when raising the issues above.
